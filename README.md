# Multi-Room Heating System
Aryan Katneni and Lucas Goldman

## Instructions to Run
Copy/clone both multiroom_heating.slx and room.slx into the same directory. Open them in the newest version of MATLAB/Simulink. Open multiroom_heating.slx to view the model. Click "Run" in order to run the model. When opening the .slx file, three windows with graphs should also pop up. These plot the temperatures of each room, the control vector h, and the location of both heaters as the simulation goes on.

If unable to run locally, we were able to run the project in MATLAB online. We uploaded both files to the MATLAB drive, then opened multiroom_heating.slx in online MATLAB. We were able to see the model, the graphs, and were able to run the simulation and see the results.

## Abstract
The goal of this project was to design a Simulink model of a multi-room heating system that included four rooms and two heaters. This model was based on a linear equation that defines the temperature of a room based on the difference between that room's temperature and other rooms, the outside temperature, and the heater's power. Using some predefined constants that guided decisions regarding the setup of the model, we could say that the model was successfully working if the temperature in each room was maintained between fifteen and twenty degrees. Based on the results of the study, we can confidently conclude that we were able to keep the system between fifteen and twenty degrees and successfully modeled the multi-room heating system using Simulink.
